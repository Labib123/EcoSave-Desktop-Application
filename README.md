# EcoSave-Desktop-Application

EcoSave is a desktop application aims to encourage community members to become collectors for recyclable materials. Collectors will receive points for collecting materials, and recyclers will also receive points for submitting materials. The EcoSave admin will set up which kinds of materials can be collected, such as paper, plastic, cooking oil or even old computers, and how much each type of material will be worth, in points. The points can be redeemed for prizes later.
